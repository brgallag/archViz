### Architectural Programming and Data Visualization: New Horizons for User Interactivity

ProgramViz allows individuals and teams to experiment with key functional adjacencies and record them, either in the space of a team meeting or from their own smart phones, tablets, or computers. The tool allows the user to experience “program” as a fluid entity, enriched by overlapping sets of data, in order to reach a level of creative freedom that could unlock the project’s hidden potential. Like peeling layers of an onion, ProgramViz it will allow users to dive to deep, eventually landing on a room data sheet with fine detail of a room requirement, and zooming back out to the macro space adjacency diagrams that the user has created. The user can then save their ideas back to a database or share them with collaborators in order to enrich the process and ultimately create the best possible design.

The process of programming architectural space has always been a critical part of a successful building initiative and we believe it should be far more intuitive, engaging, iterative, and sustained than it usually is. This cutting-edge tool helps to maximize the potential for information-gathering, the exchange of ideas amongst diverse stakeholders, and the productive assessment of individual subjectivities and collective desires. While we see the in-person meetings as extremely important, we recognize that they are limited. Social group dynamics play a part in the successful outcome of these high-value meetings, and are frequently compounded by logistical realities.

ProgramViz builds on those meetings, creates a space for an on-going collaboration, and ultimately builds a more holistic program that embeds deep thinking about the future and reflects the core values of the entire team. This process expands the program data flow and allows the conversation to breathe and become richer. Users learn from their own experience with the program diagrams and data visualization tool and then come back together for a meaningful conversation with their teams. In a more iterative, collaborative process, everyone would get the opportunity to engage with a topic that can feel inaccessible to many participants: the often-abstract early process of imagining a new space.

The vision is that this process, which uses data visualization and online user engagement to display programs and their corresponding data in ways that are intuitive, engaging, and inspirational, will someday be commonplace.
